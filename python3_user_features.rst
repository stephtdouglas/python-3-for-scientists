Useful Python 3 features for scientists
=======================================

Unicode strings
---------------

In Python 2, only the basic ASCII character set was available in standard strings; to use the much more extensive Unicode set of characters, you had to prefix each string with a u::

        "an ascii string"
	u"a unicode string ðŸ˜€"

Unicode strings are the default in Python 3. This makes it more straightforward to e.g., include foreign languages, and print greek symbols (or emoji) in strings and comments. 

Division
--------

In Python 2, integer division is the default, so 1/2 evaluates to 0. This means frequently mutiplying by 1.0 when working with integer variables, like so:: 

	int_one = 1
	int_two = 2
	int_one * 1.0 / int_two

In Python 3, the default division will yield a float, and integer division is accessed using the // operator::

	int_one = 1
	int_two = 2
	int_one / int_two # yields 0.5
	int_one // int_two # yields 0

Unicode variable names
----------------------

As with strings, Python 3 expands variable names to include most Unicode symbols, where Python 2 could only use the basic ASCII character set for variable names. This means you can use foreign language words and letter-like symbols as variable names, e.g.::

	Ï€ = 3.14159
	
	
(Sadly, no emoji here, though that functionality may be on the horizon.)

Use caution if you're planning to share your code, though, as it's fairly easy to produce illegible code this way.

Recursive glob
--------------

A small but very useful feature in Python 3 is the addition of a recursive
option in the built-in :func:`~glob.glob` function. In Python 2 and 3, this
function can be used to find all files and directories matching a certain
pattern::

    >>> import os
    >>> import glob
    >>> glob.glob(os.path.join('data', '*.fits'))
    ['data/image.fits']

Now let's say that the ``data`` directory now contains FITS files both
directly in ``data`` and in sub-directories of ``data``. In Python 3, you can
now do::

    >>> import os
    >>> import glob
    >>> glob.glob(os.path.join('data', '**', '*.fits'), recursive=True)
    ['data/image1.fits', 'data/subset1/a.fits', 'data/subset1/b.fits',
     'data/subset1/c.fits', 'data/subset2/d.fits', 'data/subset2/e.fits']

The ``**`` is used to indicate the point in the path at which to look for
recursive directories, and the ``recursive=True`` option is needed to
correctly interpret the ``**``.

.. note:: Note that we use ``os.path.join`` instead of writing out the path
          by hand (e.g. ``data/*.fits``) to make sure that this works on
          Windows as well as Linux and MacOS X.

Concurrent futures

Advanced unpacking
------------------

In Python 2, you can use implicit unpacking of variables to go from a list, tuple, or more generally any *iterable* to separate variables:

    >>> a, b, c = range(3)
    >>> a
    0
    >>> b
    1
    >>> c
    2

The number of items in the iterable on the right has to match exactly the
number of variables on the left. However, there are cases where one might
only be intersted in the first few items of the iterable. For example, if you
have a list of 5 items::


    >>> values = range(10)

and are only interested in the first two, in Python 2 you would need to do
either:

    >>> a, b, _, _, _ = values

or

    >>> a = values[0]
    >>> b = values[1]

Python 3 now allows users to use the ``*variable`` syntax (similar to ``*args`` in function argumnts) to avoid having to write out as many variables than items in the iterable::

    >>> a, b, *rest = values
    >>> a
    0
    >>> b
    1
    >>> c
    [2, 3, 4]

The ``*`` syntax can also be used for e.g. the first variable and variables in the middle::

    >>> a, *rest, b = range(5)
    >>> a, b
    (0, 4)
    >>> *rest, a, b = range(5)
    >>> a, b
    (3, 4)
    
This can be used for example to access the first two lines and the last line
in a file:

    >>> f = open('data.txt')
    >>> first, second, *rest, last = f.readlines()
    >>> f.close()
